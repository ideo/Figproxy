# What Is Figproxy?
- Figproxy is a tool that enables rapid prototyping of tangible user experiences allowing Figma prototypes to talk to the external world.  
- More specifically, it's a utility that allows bidirectional communication between Figma and physical hardware for prototyping interactions that involve screens and physical elements like motors, lights, sensors etc.  
- It's designed to talk to hardware prototyping platforms like Arduino.

## Why Did You Make It?
At [IDEO](ideo.com) I work on a lot of physical product designs that incorporate displays. I commonly work with UX designers whose tool of choice for rapid iteration of experiences is Figma. This allows me to connect their designs to hardware I work on in the initial design phase, and can enable tangible experiences without having to develop software that duplicates the on-screen interactions.

## What Does it Run On? (MacOS)
- Currently, and for the forseeable future, this is a **MacOS app only**. It would have to be developed from the ground up for Linux or Windows and I don't have time to do it.  
- An iOS app is interesting but I'm not sure if it's possible.  
- I am 100% behind someone else taking this idea and porting it to another platform.

## Use Cases
- **Kiosks** - Soda Machines, Jukeboxes, Movie Ticket Printers, ATMs
- **Vehicle UI** - Control lights, radio, seats etc.
- **Museum Exhibits** - Make a button or action that changes what is on the screen
- **Home Automation** - Prototype a UI to trigger lights, locks, shades etc. And make it actually work
- **Hardware "Sketching"** - Quickly test out functionality with a physical controller and digital twin before building a more complicated physical prototype
- **Games** - Make a physical spinner or gameplay element that talks to a Figma game
