# What Is Figproxy?
Figproxy is a utility that allows bidirectional communication between Figma and physical hardware for prototyping interactions that involve screens and physical elements like motors, lights, sensors etc.
It is designed to talk to hardware prototyping platforms like Arduino.

# What Does it Run On? (MacOS)
Currently, and for the forseeable future, this is a **MacOS app only**. It would have to be developed from the ground up for Linux or Windows and I don't have time to do it.
An iOS app is interesting but I'm not sure if it's possible.
I am 100% behind someone else taking thiss idea and porting it to another platform.

## Use Cases
- **Kiosks** - Soda Machines, Jukeboxes, Movie Ticket Printers, ATMs
- **Vehicle UI** - Control lights, radio, seats etc.
- **Museum Exhibits** - Make a button or action that changes what is on the screen
- **Home Automation** - Prototype a UI to trigger lights, locks, shades etc. And make it actually work
- **Hardware "Sketching"** - Quickly test out functionality with a physical controller and digital twin before building a more complicated physical prototype
- **Games** - Make a physical spinner or gameplay element that talks to a Figma game
