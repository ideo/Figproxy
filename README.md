# What Is Figproxy?
Figproxy is a utility that allows bidirectional communication between Figma and physical hardware for prototyping interactions that involve screens and physical elements like motors, lights, sensors etc.
It is designed to talk to hardware prototyping platforms like Arduino.
## Use Cases
- **Kiosks** - Soda Machines, Jukeboxes, Movie Ticket Printers, ATMs
- **Vehicle UI** - Control lights, radio, seats etc.
- **Museum Exhibits** - Make a button or action that changes what is on the screen?
- **Home Automation** - Prototype a UI to trigger lights, locks, shades etc. And make it actually work
- **Hardware "Sketching"** - Quickly test out functionality with a physical controller and digital twin before building a more complicated physical prototype
- **Games** - Make a physical spinner or gameplay element that talks to a Figma game

# Installation
